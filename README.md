# What are hacklets?

Have you ever wished it would be easier to just take someone's configuration
for your favourite application and use it without hassle? Or to make it easier
for your friends and collegues to use your configuration?

What about taking multiple configurations for the same application and merging
and adapting it to your own taste, then publish it as your own?

Enter *the web of **hacklets** *.

Hacklets is first of all a way of organizing things, it's a methodology. With
hacklets, you get all the above, plus:

* you remain in control of your home directory - you actually see all the
  commands being issued, there's no magic! **Magic is bad**.
* it's not only for your home directory, you can use it just like that in any
  directory
* do you use to be a Java programmer, in the next second a Python one, and
  sometimes to extend PHP in C? No problem! You can easily switch back and
  forth between configurations using *profiles*
* with hacklets, you can also manage projects, do batch operations on all of
  them (don't you want to do all those push operations after a hard day of work
  in one shot? Or fetch everything in the morning, so you have a nice overview
  of what needs to be done?)
* hacklets is not only for configuration files, but also for sharing small
  scripts and tools, or entire sets of projects
* hacklets can conduct configuration wizardry for even more control
* do you have a new collegue at your **workplace**, and want to give him all
  the projects and configurations in one shot? Throw everything
  (configurations, projects along with their code, wizards) in some hacklets
  and a profile, and you get it running in a few minutes
* do you have multiple machines (at home or work) which you want to easily
  synchronize, or you've bought a new computer and you want the same or at
  least some of your other configurations and projects on the new machine? With
  hacklets, you can easily do that
* with hacklets, you are deprived of all those repetitive tasks you do all day,
  and win time to do the real stuff that matters. Hacklets makes you **happy**
  through productivity, and makes it extremely easy for you to share that
  happyness with your friends
* easy integration with github, or any other git repository hosting (or why
  not, your own server, your own bug tracker, your own tools)
* if you develop a new tool, widget, script, configuration, or whatever digital
  information you may think of, for yourself, then you can just put it into
  a hacklet and share it. Others who have the same needs may use it, and
  improve it, and there you are, a more dynamic and collaborative environment
  from which everybody wins
* **TODO**: more advantages
